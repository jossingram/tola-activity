{"name":"TolaActivity","tagline":"Based on Tola Data, includes more project and activity specific functionality.","body":"### Tola Activity\r\nTola activity is a collection of standard data forms, reports, and visualizations designed to track the impact of organizations' programs and projects.  There are two primary sections of Tola Activity: Project Workflow and Indicator Tracking.\r\n\r\nProject Workflow is a set of standard forms that are used for project or activity-level management, facilitating traceability of data through documentation of evidence. It utilizes a set of dashboards and reports to track the progress of a project within the standard forms, workflow and process.  Currently, there are three primary forms: 1) Project Agreement, 2) Project Completion and 3) Community.  The Community form designates a geographical community and set of contacts within that community where a project or set of projects will be working.  The Project Agreement form sets the description, budget and analysis points for a project and documents the working agreements in place with the community.  The Project Completion form documents the conclusions of the project and the variance between the agreement (estimates) and the final state of the project (actuals).\r\n\r\nEach stage of a project is tracked within program dashboards allowing managers to see progress at a glance and the ability to drill down to get details or enter more information.  The three primary project forms are supplemented by standard training, event and distribution forms with links to individual attendance and beneficiary registration forms.  Project Workflow also includes a larger documentation repository to help track more in-depth or qualitative details of the project as well as a checklist, that can be customized by the user, to track and document the progress of an agreement as it nears the completion stage.\r\n\r\nThe Indicator Tracking tool is used to create a set of activity, output, outcome and goal indicators for each program, helping donors and staff track the performance of a program or project.  The indicators are defined and agreed upon by the donor(s) before a program is created in the system, then imported via a data service or manually entered.  Progress against each indicator is documented via data entry forms directly through the system or imported through a digital data collection tool or data aggregator like Tola Data.  These indicators can also be linked back to the Project Workflow in the quantitative data targets of a project to track targets vs. actuals.\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nhttp://tola.work","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
