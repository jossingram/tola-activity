It could include for example financial resources, assets, agricultural inputs, training, communications (e.g. early warning systems) or information (e.g. weather forecasting). Whilst almost any development intervention that has the outcome of reducing poverty and therefore vulnerability could be described as supporting people to cope with the effects of climate change, the definition here requires the effects of climate change to be explicitly recognised and targeted by the programme in question1.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n\u2018People supported\u2019 should relate to populations or households2 identified by the programme in question with a direct relationship to it.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n\u2018Effects of climate change\u2019 are defined here as the effects of both existing climate variability and the magnified impacts of future climate change. Normally resulting from the primary consequences of climate change of: changes to precipitation, temperature and sea level rise, these may be sudden onset or gradual, and can include floods, droughts, storms, landslides, salination, coastal inundation, heat or cold waves and biodiversity loss.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nApplication\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nThis indicator relates to the UK International Climate Fund (ICF) impact statement from the theory of change for adaptation to climate change: \u2018Vulnerable people in poor countries are prepared and equipped to respond effectively to existing climate variability and the magnified impacts of climate change\u2019. This indicator seeks to measure the numbers of people who have received an input of support as a proxy for preparing and equipping them, but does not seek to measure the output of whether this support was successful in reducing the impacts of climate change events or effects on these people, or the outcome of increasing their resilience or reducing their vulnerability to climate change. For the ICF we will seek to capture this outcome of improved resilience to climate change through evaluation and other indicators where possible. It is desirable to distinguish between numbers of poor people and numbers of vulnerable people, as not all vulnerable people are poor, and it is not always the poorest that are vulnerable, but this methodology does not encompass this definition yet. Future methodological work is planned to provide a more robust and multi-dimensional definition, and to deepen our understanding of who is vulnerable to climate change. All interventions should be in developing (non-OECD) countries, therefore at least according to this broad categorisation the people supported will be located in poor countries. However this methodology does not define which countries or people are poor or specify that these people have to be targeted by the intervention in question, though if it is possible to disaggregate by level of poverty this should be done (see the labels under the \u2018further information\u2019 section below) .\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nThis indicator should only cover bilateral spend at this stage. Multilateral and other support (e.g. direct to NGOs), will be collected and calculated separately, to ensure the same individuals aren\u2019t double counted, e.g. if supported in different ways (or even the same way) by geographically overlapping programmes.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nThere are two dimensions of \u2018support\u2019:\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n1) Targeted: defined as whether people (or households) can be identified by the programme as receiving direct support, can be counted individually and are aware they are receiving support in some form. This implies a high degree of attribution to the programme.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n2) Intensity: defined as the level of support\/effort provided per person, on a continuum but broad levels may be defined as:\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\na. Low: e.g. people falling within an administrative area of an institution (e.g. Ministry or local authority) receiving capacity building support or people within a catchment area of a river basin subject to a water resources management plan.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nb. Medium :e.g. people receiving information services such as a flood warning or weather forecast by text, people within catchment area of structural flood defences, people living in a community where other members have been trained in emergency flood response.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nc. High: e.g. houses raised on plinths, cash transfers, agricultural extension services, training of individuals in communities to develop emergency plans\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nThese dimensions are not completely exclusive, medium intensity support may be either targeted (e.g. early warning text messages) or not targeted (catchment area of a flood defence system). However high intensity support should always be targeted, and low intensity support cannot normally be considered targeted. Low intensity support should not be reported for this indicatorThere are therefore 2 categories for reporting:\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nA) Direct: Targeted \u0026amp; High intensity. Must fulfil both criteria e.g. people receiving social protection cash transfers, houses raised on plinths, agricultural extension services, training of individuals in communities to develop emergency plans and use early warning systems.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nB) Indirect: which covers:\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\ni) Targeted \u0026amp; Medium intensity: e.g. people receiving weather information and text message early warnings.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nii) Not targeted \u0026amp; Medium intensity: e.g. people within the coverage of an early warning system, or catchment area of a large infrastructure project (e.g. flood defences), or living in a discrete community in which others have been trained in emergency response\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nProgrammes are only required to distinguish direct and indirect support (and not the sub-categories of \u2018indirect\u2019 above \u2013 e.g. whether targeted or not)\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nA third category does not need to be reported at all:\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nC) Not Reported: Indirect and Low intensity: e.g. people benefiting from falling within an administrative area of an institution receiving capacity building support, or catchment area of a Water Resources Management plan or strategy (these numbers can be captured through the programme\u2019s own monitoring, and for the ICF the interventions under the \u2018institutional development\u2019 scorecard KPIs).\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nIf you are unsure how to break down the number of people your programme supports into these categories please contact the adaptation and water resource management team leads as listed at the end of this document.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nGender:\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nReporting by gender has been marked as mandatory. If you are unable to disaggregate by gender please see the additional guidance in the data disaggregation section below. A single programme may include interventions which are direct and indirect (e.g. a programme which has activities including social protection and early warning systems). A single intervention may also include people supported directly and people supported indirectly, e.g. individuals trained to develop community emergency plans and use early warning systems would be supported directly, whereas people living in the same community and benefiting from those plans would be supported indirectly\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nFurther information\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n2 further optional labels can then be applied within the above categories:\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n1. The first label is simply: Does this programme fit under any of the sectors prioritised in the ICF adaptation thematic paper? That is:\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n(a) access to social protection (if the programme is defined as an \u2018adaptation\u2019 intervention) including micro-finance and broader social protection\/insurance mechanisms;\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n(b) support to water shed and water basin management (both the construction of small-scale infrastructure at household or community level and large-scale support for watershed and water basin management activities;\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n(c) support with urban resilience including resilient infrastructure;\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n(d) support to any community and\/or national level disaster risk reduction activities;\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n(e) support for resilient agriculture programmes;\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n(f) support for eco-systems development and coastal zone management programmes; and\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n(g) support for health programmes which are primarily tackling climate change risks.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\n2. The second label considers the proportion that are poor: What proportion of the beneficiaries are poor?\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nNumbers of poor people could be determined by numbers below a country specific poverty line rather than the international $1.25\/day definition. For programmes which have indirect beneficiaries, proportions of poor could be estimated from social vulnerability analyses commissioned as part of the programme preparation or any prior Climate Change Strategic Programme Reviews.

The \u201cminimum acceptable diet\u201d indicator measures both the minimum feeding frequency and minimum dietary diversity, as appropriate for various age groups. If a child meets the minimum feeding frequency and minimum dietary diversity for their age group and breastfeeding status, then they are considered to receive a minimum acceptable diet. Tabulation of the indicator requires that data on breastfeeding, dietary diversity, number of semi-solid\/solid feeds and number of milk feeds be collected for children 6-23 months the day preceding the survey. The indicator is calculated from the following two fractions: 1. Breastfed children 6-23 months of age in the sample who had at least the minimum dietary diversity and the minimum meal frequency during the previous day ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ Breastfed children 6-23 months of age in the sample with MAD component data and 2.

Grains, roots and tubers 2. Legumes and nuts 3. Dairy products (milk, yogurt, cheese) 4. Flesh foods (meat, fish, poultry and liver\/organ meats) 5. Eggs 6. Vitamin-A rich fruits and vegetables 7. Other fruits and vegetables Minimum meal frequency for breastfed children is defined as two or more feedings of solid, semi-solid, or soft food for children 6-8 months and three or more feedings of solid, semi-solid or soft food for children 9-23 months. For the MAD indicator, minimum dietary diversity for non breastfed children is defined as four or more food groups out of the following six food groups: 1. Grains, roots and tubers 2. Legumes and nuts 3. Flesh foods (meat, fish, poultry and liver\/organ meats) 4. Eggs 5. Vitamin-A rich fruits and vegetables 6. Other fruits and vegetables Minimum meal frequency for non breastfed children is defined as four or more feedings of solid, semi-solid, soft food, or milk feeds for children 6-23 months. For non-breastfed children to receive a minimum adequate diet, at least two of these feedings must be milk feeds.

Types of relationships and resources can include: 1) Bonding Relationships that facilitate trust and support with peers within the same network. A network is typically a homogenous group of youth that share a similar identity (race, ethnicity, language, nationality, sex, religion, political outlook, neighbourhood, social background\/income, educational\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nattainment). This is often referred to as Bonding Social Capital and is intended to strengthen deep personal relationships that allow for members of the network to share personal information and receive social support from peers. In other words, this network becomes a support system for youth seeking support and guidance. In some programs, Bonding Social Capital may be considered as a necessary precondition for Bridging or Linking social capital. For example, prior to asking a group of Syrian adolescent refugees to work with Jordanian host community peers on community projects (a bridging social capital activity) it may be necessary to build trust and support within the group of Syrian adolescent refugees to address their shared condition of physical and social isolation, hardship and humiliation (a bonding social capital activity). of physical and social isolation, hardship and humiliation (a bonding social capital activity). At the same time, it\u0027s important to not build bonding social capital to the exclusion of individuals outside the group. While important for social relationships, it\u0027s important that homogenous relationships not become exclusionary to other groups. 2) Bridging Relationships, also known as Bridging Social Capital, are relationships with youth from different networks, neighborhoods, communities, religions, genders, etc. It should be defined from the beginning across which groups the programs intends to build relationships. A different network is typically not homogonous to the network the youth participant self-identifies with and may be represented by a different group based on race, ethnicity, language, nationality, sex, religion, political outlook,\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nneighbourhood, social background\/income, educational\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\nattainment.

In some programs, activities designed to build Bridging Social Capital may need to be preceded by Bonding Social Capital activities. Similarly, activities aimed at building Bridging Social Capital may be considered a necessary precondition for Linking Social Capital. For example, a young person displaced from their home province by a natural disaster and relocating to a new province would likely need to establish new relationships with people of a different ethnicity or religion (brdiging social capital) in order to then learn about and access potential employers (linking social capital) to pursue employment opportunities. 3) Linking Relationships, also known as Linking Social Capital, are relationships with people (not necessarily youth) from networks that are external (the young person doesn\u0027t currently interact with members of that nework) and provide access to power and new opportunities (education, jobs, civic engagement, etc.). The nature of these new relationships should be intended to provide the young person with new opportunities to obtain the knowledge, skills or other resources that they need to pursue future goals that are productive (do not cause harm to the individual or society). In some programs, Linking Social Capital would be preceded by program activities aiming to build Bonding and Linking Social Capital.
